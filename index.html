You can build powerful workflows between Slack, Google Sheets, or HubSpot without writing extensive code.</p><p>n8n's open-source, self-hosted platform lets you retain control of your automation needs. The platform enables unlimited workflow creation through no-code and low-code approaches that adapt to your business requirements. Advanced integration features, immediate triggers, and JavaScript functions help you design sophisticated automated processes while you keep full control of your data.</p><h2>n8n Connects Popular Services Through Built-in Integrations</h2><p>n8n's integration capabilities rely on built-in nodes. These nodes are the foundations that connect applications and services continuously. They work as building blocks that perform specific tasks like getting data, processing information, and triggering automated responses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p><h3>How n8n's Node-based Architecture Powers Workflows</h3><p>The node-based architecture has two main components: triggers and actions. Trigger nodes start workflows based on specific events or conditions. Action nodes then execute tasks within the workflow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. This setup allows complex data manipulation, external system operations, and cross-platform event triggering.</p><p>n8n nodes come with multiple operations. Users see a list of available functions after adding them to a workflow. The platform shows essential node controls on the canvas. Users can test steps, turn nodes on or off, and adjust node settings by hovering over them <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/workflows/components/nodes/"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p><p>The system manages credentials for external service authentication. These range from simple API keys to complex multi-line private keys. n8n boosts security by encrypting this data in the database. It uses a randomly generated personal encryption key for this purpose <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/node-types/"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p><h3>Top 10 Most Popular n8n Integrations in 2025</h3><p>Recent usage data shows these integrations are the most popular <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://n8n.io/integrations/"><sup>[3]</sup></a>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Google Sheets</strong>: To automate spreadsheets and manage data</p></li><li><p><strong>Telegram</strong>: To create automated messaging workflows</p></li><li><p><strong>MySQL</strong>: To handle database operations and sync data</p></li><li><p><strong>Slack</strong>: To automate team communication and notifications</p></li><li><p><strong>Discord</strong>: To manage community participation and messaging</p></li><li><p><strong>Postgres</strong>: To handle advanced database management</p></li><li><p><strong>Notion</strong>: To automate knowledge base and documentation</p></li><li><p><strong>Gmail</strong>: To manage email automation</p></li><li><p><strong>Airtable</strong>: To handle structured data</p></li><li><p><strong>Google Drive</strong>: To automate file storage and sharing</p></li></ol><p>n8n groups its integrations into specific sectors.

It processes up to 15,000 billing transactions per second <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://slashdot.org/software/p/n8n/integrations/?page=5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. This makes it perfect for small businesses and large operations that need extensive automation.</p><h2>HTTP Request Node Unlocks Access to Any API Service</h2><p>The HTTP Request node is one of n8n's most useful tools that connects to any service with a REST API <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/"><sup>[6]</sup></a>. This node helps you connect n8n with services that don't have their own integrations and opens up endless automation options.</p><h3>How to Pull Data from Services Without Pre-built Nodes</h3><p>You can use the HTTP Request node with different request methods, mostly GET and POST, to retrieve and send data. The simple setup requires you to set the request method, URL, and response format <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://blog.n8n.io/how-to-use-the-http-request-node-the-swiss-army-knife-for-workflow-automation/"><sup>[7]</sup></a>. The node works with both JSON and string responses, which makes it perfect for web scraping and API interactions.</p><h3>Creating Authentication Workflows for Third-party APIs</h3><p>The HTTP Request node gives you two ways to handle authentication. You can use predefined credential types that make the setup easy for supported services <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/custom-operations/"><sup>[8]</sup></a>. If that's not an option, generic credentials work with several authentication methods:</p><ul><li><p>Basic auth</p></li><li><p>Custom auth</p></li><li><p>Digest auth</p></li><li><p>Header auth</p></li><li><p>OAuth1 API</p></li><li><p>OAuth2 API</p></li><li><p>Query auth</p></li></ul><h3>Handling Pagination and Complex API Responses</h3><p>The node handles paginated responses in two ways <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/"><sup>[9]</sup></a>:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Response Contains Next URL</strong>: This works best with APIs that include next-page URLs in their responses. The node follows these URLs to get all the data.</p></li><li><p><strong>Update Parameter Request</strong>: This suits APIs that use page numbers or offsets. The node updates query parameters step by step, starting at zero and moving through all pages <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/code/cookbook/http-node/pagination/"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p></li></ol><p>Built-in variables help control pagination:</p><ul><li><p><code>$pageCount</code>: Keeps track of page numbers</p></li><li><p><code>$request</code>: Shows request object details</p></li><li><p><code>$response</code>: Contains response data, headers, and status codes</p></li></ul><p>The node lets you set page size limits, but most APIs have their own limits on results per request <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/api/pagination/"><sup>[10]</sup></a>. You can handle complex responses as the node processes nested data structures and extracts parameters through expressions <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p><p>The HTTP Request node makes it easy to integrate with external services, whatever their complexity or authentication needs. This flexibility helps you connect to older systems or unique APIs that don't have their own n8n nodes <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="link" href="https://docs.n8n.io/courses/level-one/chapter-5/chapter-5.1/"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p><h2>Developers Contribute Custom Integrations to GitHub Repository</h2><p>n8n's community expands the platform's capabilities through GitHub contributions.
